# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The solow model with human capital** and is about finding the steady-state and comparing the growth-rate in output with an extended model with oil as a natural diminising resource. .

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:**  The project requiresstandard Anaconda Python 3 installation. 
LateX also needs to be installed on the PC more specifically the geometry.sty package. If Lyx or a similar program has been used on the PC this should be no problem.

Here is a guide to install geometry.sty if needed:
- Go to the MikTeX Console. 
- This is an app independent from TeXwork, so you have to open it from windows. 
- You can find it in the start menu or by typing the name in the search bar. 
- Then click on the Packages Tab, right click on the package you want to install, then install.
