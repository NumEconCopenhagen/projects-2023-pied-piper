    "As well as this we have measured the number of iterations it takes to find the optimal value for the different warmup choices. Whenever we run the code we see that the number of iterations is always lower for 10 warmups, often being around half the number of iterations it takes the one with 100 warmups. This is because when using 10 warmups it quickly finds a possible global minimum and \"explores\" this in-depth. \n",

    "An upside to choosing 100 iterations is that because the optimizer explores the dataset more, it always find the global minimum. Whereas our optimizer with 10 warmups sometimes find a local minima within our tolerance and stops there. "
