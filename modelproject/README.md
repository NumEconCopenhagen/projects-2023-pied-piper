# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The solow model with human capital** and is about finding the steady-state and comparing the growth-rate in output with an extended model with oil as a natural diminising resource. .

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
